      <h1>Pokémon Team Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, you have no idea how to put together a great Pokémon team? I got
        you. Choose your favourite Pokémon, the Pokémon edition you're playing
        and/or your favourite types and this app generates a banging team for
        you.
        <br />
        The suggestions will always be the basic Pokémon but if there's any
        evolution available just push the evolve button. If the suggested team
        isn't to your taste, you can generate a new one.
        <br />
        Have fun!
