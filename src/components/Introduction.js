      <h1>Pokémon Team Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, you have no idea how to put together a great Pokémon team? I got
        you. Choose your favourite Pokémon and this app generates a banging team
        consisting of 6 different types.
        <br />
        Just choose a Pokémon via searchbar or pick a random Pokémon and add it,
        then generate your team. If the suggested team isn't to your taste, you
        can generate a new one.
        <br />
        Have fun!
